- use Wedge for head: direction + animation

- FIX glitch with rapid keystrokes: currDir vs. turnReq

- sound
- add READY state waiting for Arrow to start motion
- graphics: eyes + eyeball, eyes angle, dead eyes, eating mouth, narrow tail

- Decouple animation smoothness from cellSize / track-size

- switch to Lib/App (my throttle version of GraphicSVG) & resume SnakePic.elm
